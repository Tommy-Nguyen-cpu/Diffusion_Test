            Basic Exploration
        </p>
        The top part of the embeddings tab is the 3D plot of semantic feature space. 
        At the bottom of the tab there are expandable panels that can be opened to reveal more advanced features

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Explore the 3D semantic feature space:
                </strong> 
                Click and drag in the 3D semantic feature space to rotate the view. 
                Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. 
                Hold down the control key and click and drag to pan the view.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Find the generated image:
                </strong> 
                Hover over a point in the semantic feature space, and a window will pop up showing a generated image from this one-word prompt. 
                On left click, the image will be downloaded.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Find the embedding vector display:
                </strong> 
                Hover over a word in the 3D semantic feature space, and an embedding vector display at the bottom of the tab shows the corresponding embedding vector.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Add/remove words from the 3D plot:
                </strong> 
                Type a word in the Add/Remove word text box below the 3D plot to add a word to the plot, or if the word is already present, remove it from the plot. 
                You can also type multiple words separated by spaces or commas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Change image for word in the 3D plot:
                </strong> 
                Type a word in the Change image for word text box below the 3D plot to generate a new image for the corresponding word in the plot.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Semantic Dimensions
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Select a different semantic dimension.</strong><br>
                Open the Custom Semantic Dimensions panel and choose another dimension for the X or Y or Z axis. 
                See how the display changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alter a semantic dimension.</strong><br>
                Examine the positive and negative word pairs used to define the semantic dimension. 
                You can change these pairs to alter the semantic dimension.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Define a new semantic dimension.</strong><br>
                Pick a new semantic dimension that you can define using pairs of opposed words. 
                For example, you could define a "tense" dimension with pairs such as eat/ate, go/went, see/saw, and is/was to contrast present and past tense forms of verbs.
