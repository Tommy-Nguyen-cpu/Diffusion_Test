# DiffusionDemo

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/akameswa/DiffusionDemo/blob/master/demo.ipynb)

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of stable diffusion models, walking readers through the inner workings in a step-by-step manner. 

## Getting Started

To run the demo, click "Open in Colab". Follow the instructions to execute the code and visualize diffusion in action.

## Demo Tabs Overview

1. Clip: Visualize text embedding space in 3D with input texts and output images based on the chosen axis.
2. Animation: Observe the intermediate images in the refinement process.
3. Seed: Understand how different points in latent space can lead to different generations.
4. Spread: Explore different paths from a point in latent space. Stop to observe the resulting image.
5. Circular: Complete a full circular path in latent space and observe how the images vary along the circular path.
6. Interpolation: Walk between the prompts and observe how the output changes.
7. Poke: Modify the latent space by poking and observe its influence.
